  Nike has started the summer with the release of a brand new installment in the
  Tiempo line - the Tiempo 8. From the looks of it this boot builds heavily off
  the previous generation with a few minor updates such as the Quad-Fit
  technology which was introduced with the Phantom Vision line a little under a
  year ago. Combine this with the mostly all Kangaroo leather upper and a Fly
  Knit tongue and this boot is a sure winner.

The launch day colors were White/Pure Platinum and Black/Blue Hero; the white seeming to be more sought after pair. So, if you want a pair you better head over to nike.com and snag a pair quick. 

If I had to guess I’d say around September Nike will release a SE to commemorate Ronaldinho in the signature white and gold. If for some reason Virgil van Dijk wins the Ballon d'Or he’ll se a special release as well - fingers crossed.
