Every so often a new artist comes along that has what it takes to change the game. I’m not talking about the music industry as a whole, but more specifically the rap game; hip-hop music. I’m not going to name names but you know them when you hear them. Anyway, about 6 months back I’m browsing music videos on Youtube and I come across this relatively new artist YBN Cordae, the song “[What’s Life](https://genius.com/Ybn-cordae-whats-life-lyrics)” starts playing. From that point I knew this guy was solid.

This weekend YBN Cordae released his debut album “The Lost Boy” and I must say he has delivered. It’s too soon to see how this one will play, but after a full weekend in rotation with other songs from the likes of Rick Ross, Big Sean and another debut from Chance the Rapper the Lost Boy is holding his own. That said if you haven’t taken a some time to check it out you should!
