  Francis and the Lights just released a trimmed down version of "Take Me to the
  Light" on youtube. Though the song has only been out for about 12 hours I can
  honestly say it's one of the best songs to release this year - right along
  side the Lauryn Hill assisted Pusha T track "Coming Home".

Imagine Francis and the Lights, Kanye and Bon Iver.... before you even press play you know it's a home run! Well, I'm here to tell you this song delivers - these boys got busy. The production team is stacked and they even managed to get a contribution from Jeff Bhasker. Check the "Take Me to the Light" down below.

Also, if you haven't heard "Comng Home" yet do yourself a favor.
