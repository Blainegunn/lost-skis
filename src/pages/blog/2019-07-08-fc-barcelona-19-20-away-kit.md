  On July 9th Nike and FC Barcelona will release 2019-20 Away kit better known
  as the “La Masia”. What is La Masia you ask? It’s essentially the training
  facility where stars are born. The likes of Xavi, Messi, Iniesta and Poyul
  come to mind. The jersey is a brighter yellow color with a sash in the
  traditional FCB colors.

One first took this jersey just looks like another play on the Catalan flag, but it’s not. The design draws inspiration the kit worn by the Blaugrana in 1979, which I’m sure was inspired by the flag. Looking forward to the next season who do you think will have the privilege sport the _La Masia_ kit? Graduate or not.
